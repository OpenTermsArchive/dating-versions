**Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data**
----------------------------------------------------

Personal data is all information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address).

When we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use this data, forward it to others, or delete it.

LOVOO will only collect and process your personal data in the following cases:

* If you visit our website and are not a user.
* If you contact us directly.
* If you install the LOVOO app.
* If you register on LOVOO or subscribe to LOVOO and then use LOVOO.

You provide your personal data on a voluntary basis when entering into a contractual relationship with LOVOO or as part of an existing contractual relationship with LOVOO. However, you are required to provide special categories of personal data (e.g. the gender you are interested in, which is data relating to sexual orientation), as well as to answer questions about your LOVOO profile, in order to register on LOVOO. You must make your profile information visible to other LOVOO users in order to use the LOVOO service.

Please note that we provide the LOVOO service in many different countries and the information in your profile is visible to other users in all of these countries. Your profile will be displayed in the country corresponding to your GPS location, provided you have agreed to this, and the search settings of the respective user. If we cannot access your GPS location, we will use your IP address and country code to set your approximate location to your state capital.

If you do not want LOVOO to process your personal data or parts of it, LOVOO cannot provide its service as stated in the [Terms and Conditions](https://about.lovoo.com/en/support/legal/agb-lovoo-en/).

What data LOVOO collects in detail, you can see in the following explanations.

### Data Processing by App Stores

If you install the LOVOO app using a third-party app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple), you may have to enter into a usage agreement with the respective app store operator regarding access to its portal. To gain this access, you must have a valid account with the app store operator and an appropriate terminal device (e.g. smartphone); LOVOO has no control over data processing in this context. The app store operator of the respective app platform is the sole data controller. If needed, please contact the app store operator (third-party provider) directly for information about its data processing. In this case, LOVOO is only the data controller when the LOVOO app is used.

### What Data Does LOVOO Collect From Users in Order to Fulfill the Contractual Relationship?

LOVOO must process the personal data described below that you (also referred to as “LOVOO user”) provide during the registration process in order to render the services described in more detail in our [General Terms and Conditions.](https://about.lovoo.com/agb-lovoo-de/)

**Registration Process**

When registering, which is initially free of charge, the user is asked to provide a minimum amount of data that are required to complete the registration process. This data includes:

* Username (pseudonym)
* City
* Date of birth
* Your own gender and the gender you are interested in (the gender you are interested in indicates your sexual orientation and is therefore a special category of personal data)
* Profile picture
* Phone number (if you register via mobile phone)
* Email address
* Password selected by the user

If you have selected login through third-party providers such as Facebook, Google, Snapchat or Apple, you do not provide an email address or a password during the registration process.

Users then access LOVOO using the email address they provided and the password they selected (login credentials) or, alternatively, using the login credentials of the third-party provider.

#### Registering via Facebook (“Facebook login”)

LOVOO offers single sign-on via Facebook. This offers you the option of registering via your Facebook account. If you use the function, we receive and process the following authentication data from Facebook for the registration: Your email address, profile name, gender, date of birth, and profile picture stored there. Data is transferred in this respect.

When you log in to our website or app using Facebook, Facebook will also collect data from third-party scripts, process it for Facebook analytics purposes, or forward it to third parties. Facebook’s Privacy Policy outlines the data that may be collected when you use the Facebook login. This includes data about your device, your use of LOVOO, the websites you have visited, and the ads you have viewed. Unfortunately, you technically cannot refuse this processing on LOVOO. If you would not like Facebook to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Facebook login.

You can disassociate your LOVOO account from your Facebook account at any time on our website. In this case, we would need you to provide the aforementioned access data. Unfortunately, this cannot be done on the LOVOO app.

Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Facebook’s Privacy Policy: [http://www.facebook.com/policy.php](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php).

#### Registration/Login via Google

If you use an Android end device, we offer you the option of registering on or logging in to LOVOO via your Google account. If you do this, Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (“Google”) will provide us with the data required for registration or login (email address, name, Google Account ID, and Google Account profile picture).

We have no control over the scope of the data collected by Google using the Google login. If you would not like Google to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Google login.

Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Google, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Google’s Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

#### Registration/Login via Apple Sign-In

If you use an iOS end device, we offer you the option of registering on or logging in to LOVOO via Apple. If you choose to do so, Apple Inc., One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California, USA, 95014 (“Apple”) will provide us with the information you select and which is required for registration or login (e.g. Apple-generated email address, name).

We have no control over the scope of the data collected by Apple using the Apple login. If you would not like Apple to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Apple login.

Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Apple, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Apple’s Privacy Policy: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/sign-in-with-apple/](https://www.apple.com/de/legal/privacy/data/de/sign-in-with-apple/).

#### When registering/logging in via telephone authentication

When registering/logging in via telephone authentication we offer to authenticate by your mobile number, therefore you must provide us with your mobile phone number. We will then send you an SMS with a verification code that you must enter in the app to complete the registration process. When you want to log in, we will send you an SMS with a code that you can use to log into your account. In addition, a verification process will take place. This service (Firebase service) is provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, in the USA, and is only possible if you have given us your prior consent.

Further information about the purpose and scope of the processing of your data by Google can be found in Google’s privacy policy: [https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

**Voluntary Information**

You can also enter a variety of voluntary information in your user account, e.g. by uploading additional pictures to your profile, entering information on specific questions, and setting search filters (e.g. age and gender). This voluntary information is visible to other logged-in LOVOO users on LOVOO, but it can be deleted or modified by the account holder at any time in the user account settings. If the user specifies the gender or age he/she is looking for, only users of this gender or age will be displayed in the dating feature.

This data is specifically used for LOVOO’s feature for selecting recommendations for other user accounts according to different criteria for the user and displaying them on LOVOO. Providing additional information increases your chances of making contact with suitable LOVOO users.

**Shared Content**

LOVOO users can share content with other users through the platform, for example by sharing content in chat messages, including voice messages.

**Information Regarding Sexual Orientation**

You may provide information on our platform about your gender and the gender you prefer with regard to matches and other users. If you do provide this information, LOVOO or other users may infer your sexual orientation.

This information may be public depending on the function and/or settings on the platform. You may revoke your consent to your data being processed at any time (see section “[Your Right to Revoke Consent](#dein-recht-auf-widerruf-einer-einwilligung)” below).

**Processing of Location Data**

This online offering also includes location-based services. This includes the “Nearby” function. You can find a detailed description of this function in our [LOVOO GTCs](https://about.lovoo.com/agb-lovoo-de/). We record the location of your mobile end device using the GPS function for this purpose. This requires that you have explicitly requested the corresponding services and/or consented to the processing of location data. You can also disable our access to location data at any time in your mobile terminal device’s device settings.

**Taking out a premium subscription**

If you decide to purchase a paid LOVOO service (a “premium subscription”) through LOVOO, the following information will be collected within the order process in addition to the data collected during the basic membership:

* Surname and first name
* Payment and billing details (credit card details or PayPal data are stored by the payment provider, not by LOVOO).

**Ordering virtual goods**

If you decide to purchase credits within the LOVOO app, the following information shall be collected within the order process in addition to the data collected during registration:

* Payment details (credit card details and PayPal data are stored by the payment provider, not by LOVOO).

**Placing orders through third parties**

If you order a premium subscription or credits through an app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple) as a third-party provider, these app platform operators’ terms of use specify what personal data they process in the course of the order process. LOVOO does not process any payment and billing details in this respect.

### Communication Between Users, Communication With Our Customer Care Team, and Communication via Video Chat

LOVOO keeps a record of communication between users that takes place on the LOVOO platform, as well as of communication with our Customer Care Team. Communication between users who are logged in is encrypted.

Please bear the following in mind with regard to communication with our Customer Care Team:

In this context, LOVOO uses a service provider based in the USA (The Meet Group), with whom LOVOO has concluded a data processing agreement. It includes the EU standard contractual clauses. We need to process various data (including the IP address and profile data) in order to render these services and to moderate livestreams. If you do not want this data to be processed, you are advised not to use these services.

**Processing Purposes**
-----------------------

LOVOO processes the personal data of its users for the following purposes and in accordance with the legal bases listed below. If the data processing is conducted on the legal basis of a legitimate interest, we also explain our legitimate interest in data processing in the following:

* Zur Bereitstellung der LOVOO Plattform und damit zur Erfüllung der Leistungen, die in unseren [Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen](https://about.lovoo.com/support/legal/agb-lovoo-de/) beschrieben sind. Dies beinhaltet insbesondere:

    * Providing and use of our website and app for registered LOVOO users;
    * Providing the option of making contact and answering requests via the platform;
    * Enabling the conclusion of a contract, including invoicing;
    * (The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of the contract with you. (The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of the contract with you. In some cases, the legal basis is also your consent. The legal basis is also our legal obligation as well as the legitimate interest in providing customer service and improving the customer experience)
* To ensure compliance with our Community Guidelines and to process reports of violations of our Community Guidelines (“content moderation”); to forward reports of illegal content to the competent investigating authorities
* (The legal basis is the fulfillment of our legal obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA); in particular Articles 18 and 16 of the DSA)

(The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of our contract.)
* Preventing and fighting misuse (particularly to prevent and combat fake profiles, scamming, unlawful acts and spam, as well as ensuring the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform). LOVOO collects, processes and uses personal data – as well as geographic data and device IDs collected in connection with your registration and completion of the LOVOO profile – for the purpose of conducting automated checks to determine whether there are indications or data to suggest that LOVOO is being misused. The data is stored in a database and checked against empirical values. If automated processing reveals suspected misuse, a LOVOO employee will review the assessment and the underlying indications, and subsequently any free text information and the saved profile photos. LOVOO also provides its users with a feature called “Report profile” and checks profiles through members of the Customer Care Team in the event that other users report breaches of contract. What is more, LOVOO users can voluntarily verify themselves or are requested to do so by our Customer Care Team in justified cases (e.g. doubts about identity, suspicion of spam). If verification is successful, the profile is marked as “verified” and this is visible to other LOVOO users. You can find more information on verification [here](https://support.lovoo.com/hc/de/articles/209530749-Schritt-5-Verifiziere-dich-). Where required, users are requested to identify themselves via our service provider IDnow. More information on this is available [here](https://support.lovoo.com/hc/de/sections/360003700779?article=360016083559). (The legal basis is the legitimate interest of LOVOO and LOVOO users that the LOVOO service is not misused for acts of third parties that are in breach of contract and/or unlawful. We also have a legitimate interest in protecting our own systems to secure LOVOO’s IT and ultimately to protect the personal data of LOVOO’s users).
* Also for data security purposes (in particular availability in accordance with the obligations under Article 5 (1) (f) and Article 32 of the GDPR or Article 8 of the nFADP). (Legal basis is LOVOO’s legitimate interest in ensuring data security and LOVOO members that the LOVOO service is not abused for contractual and / or illegal acts of third parties. In doing so, we also fulfill our legal obligation in the area of data security to ensure system security and the detection and tracking of unauthorized access attempts or access).
* For personalized offers (e.g., automated price determination). In principle, we do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Article 22 of the GDPR or Article 21 of the nFADP. Instead, we only process your data with partial automation with the aim of being able to provide you with suitable product offers. The following data is used for this purpose: Country, registration device (app or website/iOS or Android). (The legal basis is the fulfillment of the contractual relationship and our legitimate interest in addressing our users in a targeted and individual manner.)
* For the protection and defense of our rights and the fulfillment of legal obligations. (The legal basis is our legitimate interest in asserting and defending our rights.)
* For the operation of our website as well as for the provision of telemedia services expressly requested by the users (legal basis is § 25 para. 2 no. 2 TTDSG)
* For the purposes of self-advertising / direct marketing through promotional emails and/or push messages, (user) surveys and individualized guides (exclusively PE Digital GmbH products). (The legal basis is PE Digital GmbH’s legitimate interest in direct marketing for its own products, as well as Section 7 (3) of the German Act against Unfair Competition (UWG). In some cases, the legal basis is also your consent.)
* For compliance with statutory retention obligations and other legal or statutory obligations and provisions (for example with regard to tax audits, official or court orders to provide information and other orders). (The legal basis is the fulfillment of our legal obligations.)
* For other communication purposes related to requests. (The legal basis may be a pre-contractual legal relationship or a legal obligation.)
* We occasionally use your data for A/B testing purposes. We use this A/B testing to analyze user behavior on our website and the LOVOO app. We show you modified content with a profile allocation on our website or the LOVOO app. This enables us to make our offering on our website and the LOVOO app even more attractive and user-friendly. Allocation criteria will be deleted immediately following the analysis to improve LOVOO’s offering. The legal basis is the legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest here is improving the user-friendliness and attractiveness of our website and LOVOO app.
* If applicable, for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89 (1) (the legal basis in these cases is Article 9 (2) (j) of the GDPR or the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (e) of the GDPR in conjunction with Article 6 (2) of the GDPR)

Information on processing purposes and the legal basis of the processing of personal data using cookies and other tracking technologies when LOVOO is used is available in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://about.lovoo.com/en/support/legal/trls-cookies/).

**Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data**
---------------------------------------------------

* To the extent that we obtain consent from the data subject for personal data processing operations, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR and the General Data Protection Regulation as incorporated into UK law by Section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (collectively referred to as the “GDPR”) or Article 31 (1) of the new Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP).
* If we process special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR Paragraph 2 a) of the GDPR – your consent – and Article 9 Paragraph 2 a) e) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis, provided that you have publicly disclosed your sexual orientation (e.g. in your profile text or in a live video).

This also applies to processing operations required to perform pre-contractual measures.
* In the case of personal data processing to fulfill a legal obligation, the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (c) of the GDPR or Article 31 (1) of the nFADP serves as the legal basis.
* If processing is necessary to safeguard one of LOVOO’s legitimate interests, or a legitimate interest of a third party, such as its users, and if the data subject’s interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms do not take precedence over the former interest, the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR or Article 31 (1) of the nFADP serves as the legal basis for processing.
* If we store information in your terminal equipment or access such information that is already stored in your terminal equipment, Section 25 (1) TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
* Insofar as the storage of information in your terminal equipment or the access to information already stored in your terminal equipment is absolutely necessary, Section 25 (2) No. 2 TTDSG serves as the legal basis.
* Further processing has Article 6 (1) of GDPR and Article 31 (1) of the nFADP as legal basis depending on processing constellation.
* In the case of personal data processing that is necessary for self-promotion (free use and subscriptions), in addition to the first sentence of Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR, Section 7 (3) of the German Act against Unfair Competition (UWG) also serves as the legal basis, or in addition to Article 31 (1) of the nFADP, Article 3 (1) (o) also serves as the legal basis.
* for archiving purposes in the public interest, for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) (the legal basis in these cases is UK GDPR Article 9(2)(j) or Article 6(1)(e) in conjunction with Article 6(2)).

If the legal basis is your consent, you are entitled to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing performed on the basis of the consent up to the time of revocation. If the legal basis is the legitimate interest, you are also entitled in principle to object to the processing of personal data pertaining to you at any time for reasons resulting from your particular situation. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect.

**FORWARDING OF DATA TO THIRD PARTIES; SERVICE PROVIDERS**
----------------------------------------------------------

As a rule, LOVOO will only disclose your personal data to third parties if this is required to fulfill a contract, if we or the third party have a legitimate interest in disclosing the data, if you have provided your consent, or if this is required to fulfill a legal obligation. To the extent that personal data is transferred to third parties on the basis of a legitimate interest, we explain our legitimate interest in this Privacy Policy.

The following personal data may also be transferred to third parties:

* to service providers, provided that the data is required to execute a data processing agreement with us;
* if applicable, to providers of market tracking technologies and analysis tools (more information is available in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://about.lovoo.com/en/support/legal/trls-cookies/));

If data may be transferred to other third parties on a regular basis, this will be explained in this Privacy Policy or in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://about.lovoo.com/en/support/legal/trls-cookies/)[.](https://about.lovoo.com/en/cookie-und-trackinghinweise-en/) In the event of a transfer based on consent, the explanation may also be provided when consent is obtained.

### Service Providers

LOVOO reserves the right to appoint service providers to collect or process personal data. LOVOO only sends service providers the personal data they need for their specific activity. LOVOO only sends service providers the personal data they need for their specific activity.

If service providers are not identified by name in this Privacy Policy or in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy,](https://about.lovoo.com/en/support/legal/trls-cookies/) LOVOO uses service providers to send emails and push notifications to LOVOO users. Service providers also provide LOVOO with server capacity. If LOVOO users make in-app purchases on LOVOO, buy “credits” or take out subscriptions, they do so using external payment providers. PE Digital GmbH does not process any payment data when a purchase is made. Depending on the payment method you select during the ordering process, we forward the data collected for the processing of payments (e.g. bank details or credit card data) to the bank responsible for the payment or to payment service providers contracted by us.

In some cases, payment service providers also collect this data themselves under their own responsibility. For instance, this is the case when you make in-app purchases using an app store operator. In this respect, the Privacy Policy of the respective payment service provider or app store operator will apply.

Service providers are generally contracted as processors who may only process the personal data of users of this online service in accordance with LOVOO’s instructions.

At LOVOO, only persons who are required and necessary for the fulfillment of their tasks receive the personal data.

### Forwarding of Data to Non-EEA Countries

Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties (jointly or severally with us) or processors located in non-EU/EEA countries. In this case, we ensure before the transfer that the recipient has an adequate level of data protection (e.g. based on an adequacy decision of the European Commission for the country in question pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR or the agreement of “standard contractual clauses” of the European Union with the recipient pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR using additional technical and organizational protective measures). Also see Article 16 (f) of the nFADP regarding the disclosure of personal data abroad.

If necessary, we also conclude a corresponding “UK addendum” with our contractual partners in accordance with the requirements set out by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and a corresponding “CH addendum” in accordance with the requirements set out by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC).

You can request that we provide you with an overview of the specific recipients (both companies within the Group and all processors) in third countries and a copy of the specifically agreed regulations (EU standard contractual clauses, if applicable, including the UK addendum or CH addendum, if relevant) to ensure the adequate level of data protection. To do this, please refer to the information in the [Contact](#kontakt-verantwortliche) section.

If this is the case, we will inform you about this separately (e.g. in the form of a separate Privacy Policy for any competition). Mandatory information is usually marked with an asterisk (\*).

**OVERVIEW OF DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS**
-----------------------------------

### **How can you assert your rights?**

Please refer to the information in the [Contact](#kontakt-verantwortliche) section to assert your rights and enable us to clearly identify you when you assert your rights.

You can also use the settings options in your LOVOO profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. There are a few exceptions to this, including a new change of date of birth, revocation of the processing of the sexual orientation information, and a change of gender, which can only be changed with the help of the Customer Care Team.

Please note that your data will usually only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent deletion.

### **Right to Information and Right to Rectification**

You have the right to request information from LOVOO as to whether we process personal data pertaining to you. You also have the right to information about this personal data and details on the category of data that is stored, the purpose of processing, any recipients, the storage period, and the data subject rights to which you are entitled. If your data is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that your data be rectified or completed. If we have disclosed your information to third parties, we will inform them of the rectification where this is a legal requirement.

If you would like to assert a right to information, please refer to the details provided in the [Contact](#kontakt-verantwortliche) section.

### **Your right to erasure**

Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we immediately erase your personal data. This is particularly the case where

* your personal data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
* the legal basis for the processing was exclusively your consent and you have revoked this;
* you have objected to the processing for commercial purposes (“objection to advertising”);
* you have objected to processing in accordance with the legal basis of balancing interests on personal grounds and we cannot demonstrate that there are overriding legitimate grounds for processing;
* your personal data has been unlawfully processed; or
* your personal data must be erased in order to comply with legal requirements.

Please note that your right to erasure is subject to restrictions.

We have the right not to comply with such a request if we process the personal data for any of the following reasons:

* For compliance with a legal obligation.
* For the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority.
* For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.
* For the establishment or defense of legal claims.

You may also erase the data in your profile yourself. To do this, log in to your profile on the LOVOO platform and erase your profile under Settings – My Account – “Delete account.” Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team and request the erasure of your data. Please refer to the information in the [Contact](https://de.lovoo.com/legal/privacy#kontakt-verantwortliche). Please note that your data will initially only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent erasure.

### **Your Right to Restriction of Processing**

Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we restrict processing. This is particularly the case where

* you dispute the accuracy of your personal data, and then for as long as we have had the opportunity to verify the accuracy;
* the processing is not lawful and you request restriction of use instead of erasure (see the previous section for this);
* the processing is not lawful and you request restriction of use instead of erasure (see the previous section for this);
* you have raised an objection on personal grounds, and then for as long as it takes to determine whether your interests prevail.

Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. Some of the data collected about you can only be modified with the help of the Customer Care Team.

### **Your Right to Data Portability**

You have the right to receive personal data, which you provide to us to fulfill a contract or on the basis of consent, in a portable format. In this case, you may also request that we transfer this data directly to a third party, provided that this is technically feasible.

To revoke your consent to the processing of your gender preference information, please email our Customer Care Team at [support@lovoo.com](mailto:support@lovoo.com) with “Objection to use sexual orientation data” in the subject line.

### **Your Right to Object to Direct Marketing**

**You may also object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes (“objection to advertising”) at any time, provided that the data processing is conducted on the basis of legitimate interest. Please note that there may be an overlap between your revocation and the use of your data in the context of an ongoing campaign for organizational reasons.**

**Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising.**

### **Your Right to Object on Personal Grounds**

You have the right to object to data processing by us for reasons related to your particular situation, provided that it is done on the legal basis of legitimate interest. In compliance with legislation, we will then stop processing your data unless we can prove that there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing your data that override your rights.

**Social Media**
----------------

The LOVOO domain contains links to PE Digital GmbH’s accounts on the social networks Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

If the user does not want the social networks to collect data about the LOVOO domain, he/she should log out of them prior to visiting the LOVOO domain. However, if you activate the relevant button by clicking on it, cookie(s) with an identifier will still be set each time you visit LOVOO.
