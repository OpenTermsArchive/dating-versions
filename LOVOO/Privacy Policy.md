**Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data**
====================================================

Personal data is all information pertaining to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth, and email address).

When we process personal data, this means that we collect, store, use this data, forward it to others, or delete it.

LOVOO will only collect and process your personal data in the following cases:

* If you visit our website and are not a user.
* If you contact us directly.
* If you install the LOVOO app.
* If you register on LOVOO or subscribe to LOVOO and then use LOVOO.

You provide your personal data on a voluntary basis when entering into a contractual relationship with LOVOO or as part of an existing contractual relationship with LOVOO. However, you are required to provide special categories of personal data (e.g. the gender you are interested in, which is data relating to sexual orientation), as well as to answer questions about your LOVOO profile, in order to register on LOVOO. You must make your profile information visible to other LOVOO users in order to use the LOVOO service.

Please note that we provide the LOVOO service in many different countries and the information in your profile is visible to other users in all of these countries. Your profile will be displayed in the country corresponding to your GPS location, provided you have agreed to this, and the search settings of the respective user. If we cannot access your GPS location, we will use your IP address and country code to set your approximate location to your state capital.

The specific data LOVOO collects is outlined below.

### Data Processing by App Stores

If you install the LOVOO app using a third-party app store operator (e.g. Google or Apple), you may have to enter into a usage agreement with the respective app store operator regarding access to its portal. To gain this access, you must have a valid account with the app store operator and an appropriate terminal device (e.g. smartphone); LOVOO has no control over data processing in this context. The app store operator of the respective app platform is the sole data controller. If needed, please contact the app store operator (third-party provider) directly for information about its data processing. In this case, LOVOO is only the data controller when the LOVOO app is used.

### What Data Does LOVOO Collect From Users in Order to Fulfill the Contractual Relationship?

LOVOO must process the personal data described below that you (also referred to as "LOVOO user") provide during the registration process in order to render the services described in more detail in our [General Terms and Conditions](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/toc).

**Registration Process**

When registering, which is initially free of charge, the user is asked to provide a minimum amount of data that are required to complete the registration process. This data includes:

* Username (pseudonym)
* City
* Date of birth
* Gender and gender you are interested in (the gender you are interested in indicates sexual orientation and is therefore a special category of personal data)
* Profile picture
* Email address
* Password selected by the user

**Voluntary Information**

You can also enter a variety of voluntary information in your user account, e.g. by uploading additional pictures to your profile, entering information on specific questions, and setting search filters (e.g. age and gender).

This voluntary information is visible to other logged-in LOVOO users on LOVOO, but it can be deleted or modified by the account holder at any time in the user account settings. If the user specifies the gender or age he/she is looking for, only users of this gender or age will be displayed in the dating feature.

This data is specifically used for LOVOO's feature for selecting recommendations for other user accounts according to different criteria for the user and displaying them on LOVOO. Providing additional information increases your chances of making contact with suitable LOVOO users.

**Shared Content**

LOVOO users can share content with other users on the platform, for example by sharing content in chat messages.

**Information Regarding Sexual Orientation**

You may provide information on our platform about your gender and the gender you prefer with regard to matches and other users. If you do provide this information, LOVOO or other users may infer your sexual orientation.

This information may be public depending on the function and/or settings on the platform. You may revoke your consent to your data being processed at any time (see section ["Your Right to Revoke Consent"](#_revoke) below).

**Processing of Location Data**

This online offering also includes location-based services. We record the location of your mobile end device using the GPS function for this purpose. This requires that you have explicitly requested the corresponding services and/or consented to the processing of location data. You can disable our access to location data at any time in the device settings of your mobile end device (see [Appendix: Technological Information](#_Anhang:_Technikhinweise)).

### Registering via Facebook ("Facebook login")

LOVOO offers single sign-on via Facebook. This offers you the option of registering via your Facebook account. If you use the function, we receive and process the following authentication data from Facebook for the registration: Your email address, profile name, gender, date of birth, and profile picture stored there. Data is transferred in this respect.

When you log in to our website or app using Facebook, Facebook will also collect data from third-party scripts, process it for Facebook analytics purposes, or forward it to third parties. Facebook's Privacy Policy outlines the data that may be collected when you use the Facebook login. This includes data about your device, your use of LOVOO, the websites you have visited, and the ads you have viewed. Unfortunately, you technically cannot refuse this processing on LOVOO. If you would not like Facebook to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Facebook login.

You can disassociate your LOVOO account from your Facebook account at any time on our website. In this case, we would need you to provide the aforementioned access data. Unfortunately, this cannot be done on the LOVOO app.

Further information about the purpose and scope of the collection and the further processing and use of your data by Facebook, as well as your rights and settings options for protecting your data, is available in Facebook's Privacy Policy: [http://www.facebook.com/policy.php](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php).

We have no control over the scope of the data collected by Apple using the Apple login. If you would not like Apple to collect data about you related to your use of our online offering and to use it for its own purposes, you should not use the Apple login.

If you do not want this data to be processed, you are advised not to use these services.

### Promotional Emails and Push Notifications

**Processing Purposes**
=======================

LOVOO processes the personal data of its users for the following purposes and in accordance with the legal bases listed below. If the data processing is conducted on the legal basis of a legitimate interest, we also explain our legitimate interest in data processing in the following:

* Providing the LOVOO platform and rendering the services that are described in our [General Terms and Conditions](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/toc). This specifically includes:
    
    * Providing our website to non-registered users;
    * Providing and use of our website and app for registered LOVOO users;
    * Providing the option of making contact and answering requests via the platform;
    * Facilitating the conclusion of a contract, including invoicing;
    * Sending emails and/or push notifications with matches or other messages related to the contract.

(The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of the contract with you. In some cases, the legal basis is also your consent. The legal basis is also our legal obligation as well as the legitimate interest in providing customer service and improving the customer experience)

* Providing a login via the LOVOO platform or the Facebook login. (The legal basis of processing is the fulfillment of our contract.)
* Preventing and fighting misuse (particularly to prevent and combat fake profiles, scamming, unlawful acts and spam, as well as ensuring the integrity and stability of the LOVOO platform). LOVOO collects, processes, and uses personal data and geodata, which are collected during your registration and completion of the LOVOO profile, for an automated check as to whether there are indications or data pointing to misuse of LOVOO. The data is stored in a database and checked against empirical values. If automated processing reveals suspected misuse, a LOVOO employee will review the assessment and the underlying indications, and subsequently any free text information and the saved profile photos. LOVOO also provides its users with a feature called "Report profile" and checks profiles through members of the Customer Care Team in the event that other users report breaches of contract. What is more, LOVOO users can voluntarily verify themselves or are requested to do so by our Customer Care Team in justified cases (e.g. doubts about identity, suspicion of spam). If verification is successful, the profile is marked as "verified" and this is visible to other LOVOO users. Further information on verification is available [here](https://support.lovoo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209530749-Step-5-Get-verified-). Where required, users are requested to identify themselves via our service provider IDnow. Further information on this is available [here](https://support.lovoo.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003700779-FAQ-Taxes?article=360016083559). (The legal basis is the legitimate interest of LOVOO and LOVOO users that the LOVOO service is not misused for acts of third parties that are in breach of contract and/or unlawful. We also have a legitimate interest in protecting our own systems to secure LOVOO's IT and ultimately to protect the personal data of LOVOO's users).
* For automated pricing. On principle, we do not use fully automated decision-making pursuant to Article 22 of the GDPR; we only process your data in a partially automated manner with the aim of offering you

suitable product offers. The following data is used for this purpose: Country, registration device (app or website/iOS or Android). (The legal basis is the fulfillment of the contractual relationship and our legitimate interest in addressing our users in a targeted and individual manner.)

* For the protection and defense of our rights and the fulfillment of legal obligations. (The legal basis is our legitimate interest in asserting and defending our rights.)
* For personal/direct advertising by means of promotional emails and/or push notifications, surveys and individualized guides (only products from LOVOO GmbH). (The legal basis is the legitimate interest of LOVOO GmbH in marketing its products directly as well as Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Unfair Competition Act (UWG). In some cases, the legal basis is also your consent.)
* For compliance with statutory retention obligations and other legal or statutory obligations and provisions (for example with regard to tax audits, official or court orders to provide information and other orders). (The legal basis is the fulfillment of our legal obligations.)
* For other communication purposes related to requests. (The legal basis may be a pre-contractual legal relationship or a legal obligation.)
* We occasionally use your data for A/B testing purposes. We use this A/B testing to analyze user behavior on our website and the LOVOO app. We show you modified content with a profile allocation on our website or the LOVOO app. This enables us to make our offering on our website and the LOVOO app even more attractive and user-friendly. Allocation criteria will be deleted immediately following the analysis to improve LOVOO's offering. The legal basis is the legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest here is improving the user-friendliness and attractiveness of our website and LOVOO app.

Information on processing purposes and the legal basis of the processing of personal data using cookies and other tracking technologies when LOVOO is used is available in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies).

**Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data**
===================================================

* If we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will serve as the legal basis.
* If we process special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 Paragraph 1 of the GDPR, Article 9 Paragraph 2 a) of the GDPR – your consent – and Article 9 Paragraph 2 e) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis, provided that you have publicly disclosed your sexual orientation (e.g. in your profile text or in a live video).
* Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 b) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data that is required to fulfill LOVOO's contractual relationship. This also applies to processing operations required to perform pre-contractual measures.
* Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 c) of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data for the fulfillment of a legal obligation.
* If processing is required to protect a legitimate interest of LOVOO or a third party, such as its users, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 f) of the GDPR will serve as the legal basis for processing.
* The legal basis for the processing of personal data required for self-promotion (free use and subscriptions) is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 f) of the GDPR as well as Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Unfair Competition Act (UWG).

If the legal basis is your consent, you are entitled to revoke your consent at any time without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing performed on the basis of the consent up to the time of revocation. If the legal basis is the legitimate interest, you are also entitled in principle to object to the processing of personal data pertaining to you at any time for reasons resulting from your particular situation. Article 21 of the GDPR applies in this respect.

**Forwarding of Data to Third Parties; Service Providers**
==========================================================

As a rule, LOVOO will only disclose your personal data to third parties if this is required to fulfill a contract, if we or the third party have a legitimate interest in disclosing the data, if you have provided your consent, or if this is required to fulfill a legal obligation. To the extent that personal data is transferred to third parties on the basis of a legitimate interest, we explain our legitimate interest in this Privacy Policy.

The following personal data may also be transferred to third parties:

* to service providers, provided that the data is required to execute a data processing agreement with us;
* where required, to providers of marketing tracking technologies and analysis tools (more information on this is available in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies));
* if we are required to do so by law or by enforceable official or court order in individual cases;
* in relation to legal disputes (with courts or our lawyers), debt collection cases or economic or operational audits (with economic/operational auditors);
* to the competent investigative authorities with regard to possible criminal acts;
* in the event of sale of the business (with respect to the acquirer).

If data may be transferred to other third parties on a regular basis, this will be explained in this Privacy Policy or in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies). In the event of a transfer based on consent, the explanation may also be provided when consent is obtained.

### Service Providers

LOVOO reserves the right to appoint service providers to collect or process personal data. LOVOO only sends service providers the personal data they need for their specific activity.

If service providers are not identified by name in this Privacy Policy or in our [Cookie and Tracking Policy](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/cookies), LOVOO uses service providers to send emails and push notifications to LOVOO users. Service providers also provide LOVOO with server capacity. If LOVOO users make in-app purchases on LOVOO, buy "credits" or take out subscriptions, they do so using external payment providers. No payment data is collected or processed by LOVOO GmbH when a purchase is made. Depending on the payment method you select during the ordering process, we forward the data collected for the processing of payments (e.g. bank details or credit card data) to the bank responsible for the payment or to payment service providers contracted by us.

In some cases, payment service providers also collect this data themselves under their own responsibility. For instance, this is the case when you make in-app purchases using an app store operator. In this respect, the Privacy Policy of the respective payment service provider or app store operator will apply.

Service providers are generally contracted as processors who may only process the personal data of users of this online service in accordance with LOVOO's instructions.

At LOVOO, only persons who are required and necessary for the fulfillment of their tasks receive the personal data.

### Forwarding of Data to Non-EEA Countries

Your personal data may also be disclosed to third parties (jointly or severally with us) or processors located in non-EU/EEA countries. In this case, prior to the transfer, we ensure that the recipient either has an adequate level of data protection (e.g. based on an [adequacy finding of the EU Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en) for the respective country pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR or the agreement of [standard contractual clauses of the European Union](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) with the recipient pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR while applying additional technical and organizational protection measures) or that sufficient consent has been obtained from our users.

You are entitled to request from us an overview of the specific recipients (processors) in third countries and a copy of the specifically agreed regulations (EU standard contractual clauses) to ensure an adequate level of data protection. To do this, please refer to the information in the [Contact](#_Toc100588501) section.

**Duration of Storage; Retention Requirements**
===============================================

We store your data for as long as this is required to provide our online offering (and the associated services) or we have a legitimate interest in continued storage. In all other cases, we delete your personal data with the exception of data that we are required to keep for longer in order to comply with contractual or statutory (e.g. fiscal or commercial) retention periods (e.g. invoices).

As soon as you revoke your consent or assert your right of revocation, we will delete the data immediately. You can delete your profile or account on LOVOO at any time in your account on the website or on the LOVOO app. Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team and request the erasure of your data. In such a case, all your data is deleted, unless statutory retention requirements or another reason (e.g. defense or enforcement of claims, evidence reasons, incidents of misuse, billing purposes, another legitimate interest) requires the further storage or processing of your data.

Please note that uninstalling the LOVOO app from your device does not delete the data in your profile.

LOVOO stores log files for up to 90 days, after which they are deleted. Log files for which further retention is required for evidence purposes are exempt from deletion until the relevant incident has been definitively clarified and may be passed on to investigating authorities in individual cases.

LOVOO stores the data required for the purpose of fulfillment or proof during the respective limitation period in connection with the assertion of data subject rights.

Shared content, e.g. content that is sent via chat messages (attachments) and the chat messages themselves: Until the user deletes the account.

**Are You Required to Provide Us With Personal Data?**
======================================================

You are not legally or statutorily required to provide us with your personal data. However, the use of certain services of our online offering may require the provision of personal data, e.g. registration or participation in a competition. If this is the case, we will inform you about this separately (e.g. in the form of a separate Privacy Policy for any competition). Mandatory information is usually marked with an asterisk (\*). If you do not wish to provide us with the necessary data, you will not be able to use these services.

**Overview of Data Subject Rights**
===================================

### **How can you assert your rights?**

Please refer to the information in the [Contact](#_Toc100588501)section to assert your rights and enable us to clearly identify you when you assert your rights.

You can also use the settings options in your LOVOO profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. There are a few exceptions to this, including a new change of date of birth, revocation of the processing of the sexual orientation information, and a change of gender, which can only be changed with the help of the Customer Care Team.

Please note that your data will usually only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent deletion.

### **Right to Information and Right to Rectification**

You have the right to request information from LOVOO as to whether we process personal data pertaining to you. You also have the right to information about this personal data and details on the category of data that is stored, the purpose of processing, any recipients, the storage period, and the data subject rights to which you are entitled. If your data is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that your data be rectified or completed. If we have disclosed your information to third parties, we will inform them of the rectification where this is a legal requirement.

If you would like to assert a right to information, please refer to the details provided in the [Contact](#_Toc100588501) section.

### Your right to erasure

Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we immediately erase your personal data. This is particularly the case where

* your personal data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected;
* the legal basis for the processing was exclusively your consent and you have revoked this;
* you have objected to the processing for commercial purposes ("objection to advertising");
* you have objected to processing in accordance with the legal basis of balancing interests on personal grounds and we cannot demonstrate that there are overriding legitimate grounds for processing;
* your personal data has been unlawfully processed; or
* your personal data must be erased in order to comply with legal requirements.

Please not that your right to erasure is subject to limitations. For example, we must or may not erase any data that we are still required to retain due to legal retention periods. Data that we need to assert, exercise or defend legal claims are also exempt from your right of erasure.

You may also erase the data in your profile yourself. To do this, log in to your profile on the LOVOO platform and erase your profile under Settings – My Account – "Delete account." Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Care Team and request the erasure of your data. Please refer to the details provided in [Contact](#_Toc100588501) to do this. Please note that your data will initially only be blocked if there are retention requirements that prevent erasure.

### Your Right to Restriction of Processing

Provided that the legal requirements are met, you may demand that we restrict processing. This is particularly the case where

* you dispute the accuracy of your personal data, and then for as long as we have had the opportunity to verify the accuracy;
* the processing is not lawful and you request restriction of use instead of erasure (see the previous section for this);
* we no longer need your data for the purposes of processing, however you need it to assert, exercise, or defend your legal claims;
* you have raised an objection on personal grounds, and then for as long as it takes to determine whether your interests prevail.

Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising. Some of the data collected about you can only be modified with the help of the Customer Care Team.

### Your Right to Data Portability

You have the right to receive personal data, which you provide to us to fulfill a contract or on the basis of consent, in a portable format. In this case, you may also request that we transfer this data directly to a third party, provided that this is technically feasible.

### Your Right to Revoke Consent

If you have granted us consent to process your data, you may revoke this consent at any time with future effect. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the time of revocation remains unaffected by this.

You have provided us with data regarding your sexual orientation (gender and gender you are interested in). You may revoke this consent at any time with future effect. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until the time of revocation remains unaffected by this. From the time you object to the processing of your sexual orientation data, matches can no longer be made unless you consent again to the processing of your sexual orientation data, and LOVOO will no longer be able to provide its services as described in our [General Terms and Conditions](https://www.lovoo.com/legal/toc) as a result of your objection. To revoke your consent to the processing of your gender preference information, please email our Customer Care Team at [support@lovoo.com](mailto:support@lovoo.com) with "Objection to use sexual orientation data" in the subject line.

### Your Right to Object to Direct Marketing

**You may also object to the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes ("objection to advertising") at any time, provided that the data processing is conducted on the basis of legitimate interest. Please note that there may be an overlap between your revocation and the use of your data in the context of an ongoing campaign for organizational reasons.**

**Alternatively, you can use the settings options in your profile to rectify the data you provided during registration or to object to advertising.**

### Your Right to Object on Personal Grounds

You have the right to object to data processing by us for reasons related to your particular situation, provided that it is done on the legal basis of legitimate interest. In compliance with legislation, we will then stop processing your data unless we can prove that there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing your data that override your rights.

### Right to Lodge a Complaint With the Responsible Regulatory Authority

You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. You may contact the data protection authority responsible for your place of residence, your federal state, or the data protection authority responsible for us.

**Social Media**
================

The LOVOO domain contains links to the accounts of LOVOO GmbH on the social networks Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. Once the embedded graphic has been clicked on, the user is redirected to the page of the respective provider of Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook, or Google+, which means that only then is user information transferred to the respective provider. In this case, the user's consent will be the legal basis for data processing pursuant to Article 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 a) of the GDPR.

If the user is logged in to his/her user profile in the respective social network, an association with the visit to LOVOO is made after the button is activated.

If the user does not want the social networks to collect data about the LOVOO domain, he/she should log out of them prior to visiting the LOVOO domain. However, if you activate the relevant button by clicking on it, cookie(s) with an identifier will still be set each time you visit LOVOO. As a result, this function may be used to collect data and create a profile that may be attributed to an individual person. If the user does not want this, he/she can deactivate the respective link within the LOVOO domain in one click. The user can also adjust his/her browser settings so that the acceptance of cookies is generally excluded; however, please note that in this case the functionality of LOVOO may be limited.

Information on the handling of personal data when these websites are used is available in the respective privacy policies of the providers.
