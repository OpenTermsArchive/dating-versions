_Last updated September 19, 2022._

[Privacy Notice for California Residents](https://lex.helpscoutdocs.com/article/67-ccpa)

The Lex mobile application (the “App”) and website (the “Site” and collectively with the App, the “Services”) are provided by Personal Best, Inc. (“Personals”). We respect your privacy and have designed the Services with your privacy in mind. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal information and what choices you have with respect to the information when you use our mobile application.  
   
We may update or amend this Policy in our sole discretion. If we make material changes to this Policy, post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date the policy was last revised. We will also notify you of any material changes either through a pop-up notice, email or through other reasonable means. Continued use of the Services after any such changes to the Policy have been made shall constitute your consent to such changes. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the most current version of the Policy, which is available in the Services. When we change this Policy, we will modify the “Last Updated” date above.  
  
**INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION  
**  
We receive or collect various personal data when you install and use the Services. This Policy sets out what personal data we may collect, how we process and protect that data and the lawful grounds for that processing. In most cases, the lawful ground will be that the processing: (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business, including to grow and improve the Services, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests (“Legitimate Interests”), (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you (“Contract”), or (iii) we have a legal obligation to carry out the processing (“Legal Obligation”). Where processing is based on your consent (“Consent”), we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.

You can also choose to link your App account with your Instagram account. You may also have the option to upload an image to your App account, and may need to allow the App to access the camera and/or photo album on the your phone to do so. Any image you upload will be visible to other users of the App, and as such must comply with this Policy and our Terms of Use.  
   
**Your Location  
**When you create an account, we ask you to share your location with us through the App in order to use all features. We use your location to determine your distance from other users and to help you find personals and missed connections in your area. We collect this information automatically by collecting your Internet Protocol address and your Unique Device ID. It is possible to opt out of sharing your location at sign up, but app functionality is limited. Read more [here](https://help.thisislex.app/article/87-do-i-have-to-share-my-location).

**EEA AND U.K. DATA SUBJECTS  
**  
The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in the European Union (“EU”), the European Economic Area member states (“EEA”), and Switzerland, in relation to their personal data. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:

*   Right of Access - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
*   Right to Rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
*   Right to Erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
*   Right to Restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
*   Right to Object:
    *   The right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
    *   The right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
*   Right to Data Portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
*   Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.

If you wish to exercise any of the above rights, please submit a [GDPR Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhK2fkBounO1PeN75s7OU0Ey1tmMpGEQYd9lD8EQWAH8DPKA/viewform).

EEA individuals also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in the EEA Country where they reside or work, or where the alleged infringement of the GDPR took place. You can find information about your data protection regulator [here](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Swiss individuals also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. For complaints from EEA data subjects or Swiss individuals that cannot be resolved with us directly, we will cooperate with EEA and Swiss authorities and will implement the advice they provide with respect to such unresolved complaints.

**INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION  
**   
The internet is a global environment. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction through cross-border data transfers (e.g., to the United States of America and other jurisdictions). By using the Services and/or communicating electronically with us, you acknowledge and agree to our processing of your information in this manner, and agree to be bound by all applicable privacy laws. We use reasonable safeguards to permit data transfers to these other jurisdictions and may implement standard contractual clauses, where required, with other companies, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data. 

**SECURITY**  
  
We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal data. However, no method of electronic storage or method of transmission over the internet or phone lines is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the protection of any information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, or that any information may not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. Consequently, when you transmit your personal data to us, you do so at your own risk.  
   
If you create an account via the App, your account information will be password-protected. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your username and password, as well as to your smartphone or other mobile device. We request that you not communicate any confidential or sensitive information to us through email, social media, or any other means.  
   
If we learn of a security system breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services or providing personal data to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security and privacy issues related to the Services. We will endeavor to provide notice to you of any security systems breach and efforts to restore the integrity of the Services in accordance with applicable law. If you become aware of any breach of data security or have any other questions about the security of the Services, please contact us at [support@thisislex.app](mailto:mailto:support@thisislex.app).  
   
The security of personal data also depends in part on the security of the smartphone or mobile device you use to communicate with us, the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, and the security provided by your internet service provider or mobile carrier. We are not responsible for the security of your internet service provider or mobile carrier.
