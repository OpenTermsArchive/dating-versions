**DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Study Hall a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.  
  
The notice must include the following information:

*   A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
    
*   Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
    
*   Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Study Hall to locate the material on the Site;
    
*   Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available);
    
*   A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
    
*    A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an          exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
    

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.

Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA, which can be found at [http://www.loc.gov/copyright/](http://www.loc.gov/copyright/). Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to [support@thisislex.app](mailto:mailto:support@thisislex.app). Please consult your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA
