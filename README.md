## Context

[Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org) is free and open source software that publicly records every version of the terms of digital services, increasing their readability and highlighting their changes to [enable democratic oversight](https://opentermsarchive.org/impact). In its [vocabulary](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/#main-concepts):

- A **version** is a record of a service’s terms cleaned of the legally irrelevant parts (e.g. menus, ads…) of an online document. Each version represents the state of the terms at a specific point in time. They are publicly recorded to provide a history of how the terms evolved over time.
- A **collection** is a group of terms characterised by their language, jurisdiction and industry.

Detailed information about this specific collection, including how to request or contribute terms, can be found in its [declarations repository](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dating-declarations).

## Missing terms

Each collection has a specific scope, and its maintainers might or might not have the intention to track the terms you are interested in.

If some versions are missing, the maintainers of this collection might benefit from your help: check [open issues](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/dating-declarations/issues) for known necessary corrections or open a new one.

If specific services, or specific terms for a service, are missing from this collection, they may be available in other [public Open Terms Archive collections](https://opentermsarchive.org/#collections).

If not, you may just be the best person to add them by [following the documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/contributing-terms)!
