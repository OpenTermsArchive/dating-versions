Cookies & other tracking technologies when using the eharmony website

**Cookies & Tracking**

In addition to the processing of personal data described in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.eharmony.co.uk/privacypolicy), cookies and other tracking technologies are stored on your device when or after accessing the eharmony website.

A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your device when you access a website and is stored in your browser. If you access the same webpage again later, your browser will check its cookies and will recognize you as a returning user.

Third party technologies such as scripts, pixels and tags that eharmony embeds in the eharmony website for promotional purposes also place cookies on your device.

Some cookies are automatically erased after the end of the browser session (“session cookies”), whereas other cookies are stored for a predetermined amount of time or permanently in your browser, and then erase themselves automatically (“temporary” or “permanent” cookies).

Cookies do not store any data that identifies you as a person (e.g. no names, e-mail addresses or IP addresses). Instead, cookies typically contain a code (so-called identifier) as well as information on the storage period and possibly also certain technical features (e.g. security functions).

**What categories of cookies does eharmony use?**

Eharmony classifies cookies and other tracking technologies (hereinafter also collectively referred to as "cookies") into different categories depending on their function and purpose.

**“Essential” cookies**

Certain cookies are essential to the eharmony website, as they ensure the safe and proper functioning of our Service.

This category of cookies includes, e.g.:

*   Cookies that identify or authenticate our users, and cookies needed for a secure authentication process;
*   Cookies that ensure the security of eharmony’s information system;
*   Cookies that control abuse;
*   Cookies that temporarily store certain user entries;
*   Cookies that store certain user preferences.

These cookies enable you to navigate safely on our website and use the functions as desired. Without these cookies, eharmony cannot provide its essential services. We only use these cookies when you visit our website. These cookies are also used to retrieve the optimised website display when you access our website with a mobile device, so that your mobile data volume is not unnecessarily consumed.

The legal basis is the legitimate interest of eharmony and its members that the eharmony Service is safe, easy to use, and constantly being improved.

A consent is not required to use "essential" cookies. They cannot be deactivated.

You will find an overview and more detailed information about the "essential" cookies we use in our [CMP](#uc-info-modal-show).

  

**“Marketing” Cookies**

We also use cookies for advertising purposes (“marketing“ cookies). We use user behaviour profiles created with the help of these cookies (e.g., which banner ads you have clicked on, which subpages you have visited, which search queries you have made) to measure the performance/ success of our advertisements, gain insights into target groups and display advertisements or products that are relevant to you.

In this context, we also allow other companies to collect our users’ data via cookies. We also forward tracking data to companies like Google and Microsoft so that we can measure the success of advertising campaigns (“conversion tracking”).

These companies may process the collected data for their own purposes, including and in particular for the purpose of providing their web analysis and tracking services. They may also combine the data they have collected using cookies with other data captured on the websites of the respective companies. Thus it may be possible for the companies to create usage profiles.

The legal basis for data processing is your consent.

We process your data alone or with the help of processors in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR, who process your data on the basis of our instructions and not for their own purposes. Where we jointly process personal data for certain purposes and by jointly determined means, we and the companies are joint controllers pursuant to Article 26 UK GDPR. In other cases, the companies also process personal data independently. Additionally, some companies may be based in or transfer data to non-UK countries.

**You will find an overview and more detailed information on the “marketing” cookies that we use and the companies that we work with as well as the purpose of data processing** [here](#uc-info-modal-show).

You can object to the processing of data on your device related to cookies at any time. You can find out how to object to your data being processed under the heading [“How can you manage, prevent the use of, or erase cookies?“](#pp23). With tools that work with opt-out cookies, it should be noted that the opt-out function is device- or browser-specific and is only valid for the device or browser currently in use. If you use several devices or browsers, you must set the opt-out on each individual device and in each browser used. You can also prevent any user profiles being created by objecting to the use of cookies in general.

If you do not agree with the use of marketing cookies and object to their use, you will be shown advertisements that may be less relevant to you.

**Legal basis for the processing of personal data in connection with cookies**

*   Where we obtain your consent as our lawful basis for processing, our legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1) (a) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).
*   When the processing of your personal data is required to fulfil our contractual relationship (either in relation to Basic Membership or Premium Membership), our legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1) (b) UK GDPR. This also applies to any processing of data that is required to carry out any pre-contractual actions.
*   If the processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interest of eharmony or a third party, such as our members, and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override those legitimate interests, our legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1) (f) UK GDPR.

When the legal basis for processing is your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. However, this withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out on the basis of your consent before your withdrawal. If the legal basis is a legitimate interest, you are also entitled, in general, to object to the processing of your personal data, at any time, for reasons arising from your specific situation. Article 21 UK GDPR applies in this respect.

**How can you manage, prevent the use of, or erase cookies?**

With the exception of “essential” cookies, we only use cookies with your consent. Using eharmony’s CMP, you can decide on your preferred use of cookies and review cookies already stored on your computer. You are also free to change any previous decisions regarding cookies at any time and you may (for instance) subsequently withdraw any consent you have given. To do so, you can access the settings options in our [CMP](#uc-first-modal-show).

If you would like to contact us regarding your consent, please refer to the information provided for this purpose in the Contact section of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.eharmony.co.uk/privacypolicy) or e-mail us at [privacypolicy@eharmony.co.uk](mailto:privacypolicy@eharmony.co.uk) and enter your consent ID and date of giving consent.
