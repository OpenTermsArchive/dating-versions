HER privacy policy
------------------

**Last Updated: 3/11/2025**

Welcome to HER! This Privacy Policy explains how our company, Bloomer Inc., doing business as HER (“**HER**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, or “**our**”) handles Personal Information (as defined below) collected from our website, located at [www.weareher.com](https://www.weareher.com/) (the “**Website**”) and through the use of our mobile application (the “**Mobile** **App**”) (collectively,  the “**Services**”). Our Website provides information about us, allows you to download the Mobile App, and allows you to sign up for our newsletter.

**Our Services.** Our Services allow you to connect and communicate with other members of the LGBTQIA+ community for dating, fun, friendships and more!

When we use the phrase “**Personal** **Information**” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that describes or indicates an identified or identifiable individual. When we use the phrase

“**Anonymous** **Information**” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to any Personal Information except as expressly stated in this Policy, and does not enable identification of or contact with individual persons.

**Users Outside of the United States.** HER is based in the U.S. If you are a non U.S. user of the Services, by visiting the Website and/or using the Mobile App, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Information may be transferred to and/or processed in the United States for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. In addition, your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than and less protective of Personal Information than the laws in your country. By providing your information and agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you consent to any such transfer.

#### Information we collect

**Personal information**

[In general, the Personal](https://links.weareher.com/XKUPX2dxBob) Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you, to improve and maintain the Services, and to better understand how users interact with the Services.

Specifically, we collect the following types of Personal Information:

* * Identifiers, such as real name, online identifier, Internet Protocol (“**IP**”) address, email address, account name, or other similar identifiers.

* * Categories of personal information described in Section 1798.80(e) of the California Civil Code, such as name, physical characteristics or description, telephone number, education, or employment history, credit card number, or any other financial information.

* * Characteristics of protected classifications under federal law, such as religion, gender (including pregnancy) and age (40 years old and over), or under California law, such as marital status, age, or sexual orientation.

* * Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with a website, application or advertisement.

* * Geolocation data.

* * Audio, electronic, visual information or similar information.

* * Professional or employment-related information.

* * Education information.

* * Inferences drawn from the above categories of information.

**The categories of sensitive information include:**

* * Account login in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to the account.

* * Information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation.

* * Contents of mail or text messages, unless we are the intended recipient of the communication.

* * Precise geolocation data.

When you create a profile, you have the option of adding a name (given, chosen, real, or fake, at your election), photos, a bio, and certain other details about your gender, your sexual orientation and your dating preferences, as well as answering some standard preferences. All of this information is optional. Whatever you choose to add to your profile will be visible to other users of the Mobile App.

**Profile and Account Information_._** You can choose to sign up for the Mobile App using different types of Personal Information, and choose which items of your Personal Information you want to share as you otherwise use the Mobile App. To sign up, you can choose to submit your phone number, email, AppleID, or sign up with a Facebook or Instagram account (a “Social Account”). Whichever option you choose, we will collect that information and associate it with your account.

If you sign up with a Social Account, the social platform will share your name, birthdate and email back with us, with your consent, but it will always allow your account to connect with us to authenticate you. If you’d like to disassociate your Social Account form your HER account, you can do so in the app, or by contacting us at [support@weareher.com](mailto:support@weareher.com).

When you have an account with us, unless you’ve disabled location services, the Mobile App will automatically collect your location when you open it. Upon initial download and sign-in to the account on the Mobile App, we will request consent to access your device location to allow us to find potential matches and other nearby users in the “Meet” and “Nearby” function of the Mobile App.

During signup, we will also request your birth date, which we use to calculate and display your age to other users and confirm you are an adult.

**Voluntary Information.** We also collect other types of Personal Information that you provide to us voluntarily, in addition to information that you provide voluntarily to us to populate your profile and use the Mobile App. We may also receive information you volunteer if you choose to contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services, sign up for the newsletter on the Website, participate in a survey, sign up for an event through a platform like Eventbrite and share your name and email, participate in a Sweepstakes (subject to the applicable Sweepstakes Rules), offer feedback or submit a request for support through the Mobile App.

**Usage Information.** We collect certain non-identifiable information about your use of the Mobile App, such as patterns of clicks, session length, messaging patterns and other similar technical information (“**Usage Information**”) when you use it. When you use the Website, this may include your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your device when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), a date/time stamp for your visit, and/or other similar technical information.

**Analytics Information_._** Under some circumstances when you use the Mobile App, this Usage Information is collected in association with Personal Information through the function of third party services we use to improve the business (when so combined, “**Analytics** **Information**”). We use Analytics Information to understand our users’ behavior and improve the Services. For example, services that help us analyze users’ messaging behaviors may do so according to demographic or Personal Information. We use analytics to understand how many visitors our Website has and where they come from. As another example, we may use a third party service to examine which of [our marketing efforts our](https://links.weareher.com/XKUPX2dxBob) users interact with and how this impacts users’ journeys through our [Services. The Analytics In](https://links.weareher.com/XKUPX2dxBob)formation used by such third party services may be both stored and accessed by the third party operators of these services, and may be sent to and/or shared with our own servers and cloud providers, as further described below. HER team members may also access part of all of this Analytics Information in the course of our company’s use of these services. At times, our analytics services may consult or ingest Usage Information, and may do so in a manner that causes it to be associated with your Personal Information.

When we do so, we generally secure contractual promises to keep our user data confidential and use it only for the purpose of delivering services to us.

For example, we currently use a service called [Branch](https://branch.io/) to understand how users find our Mobile App. Branch generates URLs for use in our marketing campaigns, and when users click those links, a persistent identifier is placed onto the user’s device (including mobile devices) to indicate to us (1) the source of the marketing lead, (2) whether that user has created an account, (3) and whether the user has made a purchase and/or a swipe. To read more detailed information about Branch’s services and the data handling practices applicable to all users of those services, visit Branch’s privacy policy [here](https://branch.io/policies/privacy-policy/) and consult Branch’s terms of service.

We also currently use a service called [Braze](https://braze.com/) to help understand our advertising interactions with users, analyze messaging behaviors in the Mobile App, and manage our marketing campaigns. Braze recreates our databases of this information locally in order to run this analysis, help us plan push notifications and other communications with users, and understand certain user interactions in the Mobile App. You can read more details about Braze’s confidentiality protections and use restrictions in their [Terms of Service](https://www.braze.com/company/legal)[,](https://www.braze.com/company/legal) and more about their data handling practices in their [Privacy](https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy) [Policy](https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy). At times, we may input Voluntary Information into these services to improve their functionality.

**Cookies**. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “**Cookies**” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the Website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until they expire or you delete them). Our Website, or our emails to you, may contain similar “web beacon” or “clear GIF” elements which tell us when an email has been acted upon (such as opened or forwarded).

We may use Google Analytics. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personal Information. Please refer to Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information. You may also choose to download the [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/181881).

You may wish to restrict the use of cookies. Please be aware that some of the features of our Website may not function correctly if you disable cookies. Most modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the options or preferences menu of your browser. To understand these settings, the following links for commonly used browsers may be helpful: [Cookie settings in Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&ref_topic=14666)

* * [Cookie settings in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer?redirectslug=Cookies&redirectlocale=en-US)

* * [Cookie settings in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/search?query=enable%20cookies%20in%20edge)

* * [Cookie settings in Safari web](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-sfri11471/mac) and [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105082)

**Location Information**_._  If you have enabled location services on your phone, we collect precise geolocation information from your device. We share this information as rough geolocation to give users you interact with an approximate estimate of their distance from you.  If you do not want this information collected by us, you can disable location services on your phone for the Mobile App. If location services are not enabled for the Mobile App, you won’t be able to see any other users in the “Meet” or “Nearby” functions of the app.

**Other.** We may also collect Personal Information at other points through our Services that state that Personal Information will be collected as a result of a specific action you take.

**Collection of Data by Advertisers on our Mobile App**_._ We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Services. Your Account Information and Usage Information may be used by these third parties to choose advertisements likely to be relevant for you. We follow the guidelines of mobile application platforms (the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) in serving targeted advertisements to you through the Mobile App in connection with these third parties. For more information, please see the “How to update, access, and modify your personal information in-app” and “How to opt out” sections below.

How we use information we’ve collected
--------------------------------------

**Personal information**

We will use your Personal Information, both directly and in connection with the third party services described in this Policy, to:

* * Identify you as a user in our system;

        * * To display your friends to other users, if and when you add friends;

        * * Select and display relevant advertisements of third party products and services that may be of interest to you, in compliance with guidelines and restrictions imposed by the App Store and Play Store platforms.
        

We may also use your Personal Information to extract Anonymous Information records by excluding information that would allow the identification of any particular individual. We generally use Anonymous Information, which is not associated with an identifiable individual, that we collect to analyze trends, administer and improve the Services, understand the demographics of our aggregate user base, and tailor the Services to our users’ needs. We may use Anonymous Information in other ways, including sharing it publicly. This may include sharing anonymous statements by our users about the product or Services.

### How we disclose and share information

**Personal information**

We do not disclose or share your Personal Information with third parties other than as described in this Policy. In addition to the sharing described as a part of how we collect data, we may disclose certain Personal Information to third parties in the following ways:

* * As You Request. When you use the Services, the Personal Information you provide will be shared with the third parties that you authorize to receive such information (e.g., other individuals that you wish to connect with via the Services). You choose which information about you will be displayed to possible connections in the Services.
        
        * * Spotify. You can, but do not have to, choose to connect your Spotify account to your Mobile App profile to display music you listen to frequently.
        
        * * Social Media Profiles. If you use your Facebook and/or Instagram accounts to log into the [Mobile App, yo](https://links.weareher.com/XKUPX2dxBob)u can choose to import certain data from those accounts to improve your [experience on th](https://links.weareher.com/XKUPX2dxBob)e Mobile App.
        

* * Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with our third party service providers who provide services such as data analytics, website hosting, payment processing (e.g., Stripe and RevenueCat), information technology, customer service, email delivery, auditing, and other services. In particular:
        
        * * Servers and Hosting. Like most modern applications, our Services use cloud-based server and hosting tools operated by third parties, and your Personal Information is stored on those third party servers. Our servers and databases, as well as the data we store there, are secured and encrypted with industry-standard tools. In some cases, we also use data analysis tools which replicate our server and/or some data on those servers in order to help us optimize our operations.
        
        * * Data processing and Analysis. We use certain third party software tools to analyze, visualize, and process data about our Services and how users interact with them, as well as to transmit that data effectively to cloud servers. The third party vendors may store or have access to your Personal Information for the purpose of providing their services to us. Data handled by these vendors is subject to Encryption of at least TLSv1.2 in transit and AES Encryption at rest. Services that help us manage data flows (for example, data pipeline, data handling, and data visualization services operated by third parties) generally do not store our data, but many have access to it in the course of delivering their services.
        
        * * Subscription Management. We use a third party service, RevenueCat, to help manage and analyze subscription revenue. You can read more about RevenueCat’s Privacy Practices with respect to you as a HER user in their Privacy Policy [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).
        

* * Ad Display. We may share your Personal Information in order to select and display targeted advertisements. Currently, vendors such as [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com/) provide services for this purpose, though the particular vendors we use may change over time. You can read AppLovin’s Privacy Policy [here](https://www.applovin.com/privacy/)[.](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/audience_network/publisher_tos/) You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising by emailing support@weareher.com. Please read the Section below on “How to opt out” for more details about this.

If you would like more information about these targeted advertising services and the choices about the use of your information they support, please visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). If you’re in the EU, you can find additional information about your choices with respect to advertising networks and online behavioral advertising by clicking here: [http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) Using these general opt-out tools will remove your information from certain services we use, such as Braze.

* * Public Profile and Profile Sharing. Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be displayed in your Profile.  As an essential element of the Services, most of the Personal Information you choose to explicitly provide to us when you register or update your Profile is displayed on your Profile and therefore to other users of the Mobile App. You can make your profile “Incognito” by toggling the radio button for that Setting in the “Edit Profile” Display, which is accessible by clicking “Edit” in the top right corner of your profile screen within the Mobile App. You can block specific users from interacting with you on the Mobile App by clicking “Block” at the bottom of their profile, and Report users who are not in compliance with our [Community Guidelines](https://weareher.com/community-guidelines/) or who take action which makes you in any way uncomfortable from the link at the bottom of their profile as well. **Finally, you and other users can share a profile via text message or email – and your own profile can be shared publicly in this way.** When another user takes this action, your primary profile photo, first name, and age will display to the recipient of the share. However, clicking the link associated with this display will only open the shared profile in our Mobile App for another registered user of HER. We cannot control who reads your postings, takes screenshots of your data and photos, or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, including another user’s profile, so it is very important that you do not put Personal Information in your messages, posts, and/or profile that you are uncomfortable having shared by other users. Once you have posted information publicly, you may not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others.

* * Affiliates. We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“**Affiliates**”).

* * Corporate Restructuring. We may share some or all of your Personal Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time.

* * Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information (as described below), we may disclose Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our [Terms and Conditions](https://weareher.com/terms/) or [Community Guidelines](https://weareher.com/community-guidelines/); (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties; and/or (d) investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our [Terms and Conditions](https://weareher.com/terms/), or harm (including potential harm) to HER or other users.

### How we respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a Do Not Track signal to websites and other online services you visit. We do not alter our practices when we receive a Do Not Track signal from a visitor’s browser because we do not track our visitors to provide targeted advertising on the Website. To find out more about Do Not Track, please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com.](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/)

If you have questions about the lawful bases of how we process your Personal Information, contact us at [support@weareher.com](mailto:support@weareher.com).

**International Transfers of Data.** Any data that you provide to us may be accessed, shared, or processed by our offices, located in the United States, and service providers located in the United States, if such data transfer is necessary for the specific purpose for which you submitted your data (such as the provision of goods or services under a written contract).

We maintain appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law for any Personal Information transferred internationally.

We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to first address your concerns and would welcome you directing an inquiry to us via the information in the “Contact Us” section at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

### Children’s Privacy

Our Services are not directed to children and no one under the age of 18 is eligible to use our Services. You are only able to join the Services with a birthdate that indicates you are over 18.

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we know are under 16 years of age under any circumstances, and no part of our Services is designed to attract people under 16 years of age. If we learn that a user is under 16 years of age and has misrepresented their birthday to us, we will take steps to promptly remove that user’s Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services. Please notify us immediately at support@weareher.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected information about any person age 16 or younger.

### How to update, access, and modify your personal information in-app

We provide you with a simple tool in the Mobile App to control your information through your settings menu.

To access this tool, from your profile, click the settings icon at the top right. From your profile settings, scroll down to “Privacy Options” and tap. From here, you can choose “Send me my data,” “Stop using my data,” or “Delete my account and data.”

* * Send me my data. When you select this option, we’ll email you a copy of the data we hold about you. Note that to use the “Send me my data” function, you’ll need to have added an email to your profile and verified that email. We’ll send your data only to verified emails.

* * Stop using my data. When you select this option, we’ll stop using your data to serve ads to you. You may still see ads, but they won’t be personalized.

* * Delete my account and my data.  When you select this option, we’ll delete your account and the data it contains. Note that you won’t be able to use your account after doing this.

### How to opt out

In addition to the standard mechanisms above for managing your data, if you’d like to opt out of a particular use of your data described in this Privacy Policy, you can email us at [support@weareher.com](mailto:support@weareher.com).

### Data security and retention

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information when you enter, submit, or access your Personal Information. However, no website, application or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we have established and maintain what we believe to be appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Personal Information obtained through the Services, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

We retain information about you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of Services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrollment with our Services, the impact on the Services we provide to you if we delete some of the information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law, and the statute of limitations.

###  Changes to this privacy policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at [www.weareher.com/privacy](https://weareher.com/privacy/) and we will change the “Last Updated” date above. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.
