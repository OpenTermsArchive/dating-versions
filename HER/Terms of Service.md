### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, and we both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the District Courts of California. This means that, if you are a citizen of a country in the EU, you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights in connection with these Terms in California or in the EU country in which you live.

### Enforcement of Terms

Even if we delay in enforcing these Terms, we can still enforce them later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking these Terms, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things, and it will not prevent us from taking steps against you at a later date.

### Rights and Waiver

No delay or omission by either party hereto to exercise any right or power occurring upon any noncompliance or default by the other party with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement shall impair any such right or power or be construed to be a waiver thereof. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived or amended only in writing and only by the party that is entitled to the benefits of the term(s) or condition(s) being waived or amended. Unless stated otherwise, all remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity, or otherwise.

### Severability

If any provision of this Agreement or any word, phrase, clause, sentence, or other portion thereof should be held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, then such provision or portion thereof shall be modified or deleted in such a manner as to render this Agreement as modified legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws.

### Authorization and Transfer of Terms

The party entering into this Agreement hereby acknowledges, represents, and warrants that he or she is expressly and duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and to legally bind said party to this Agreement.

Arbitration Agreement and Dispute Resolution.
---------------------------------------------

### Arbitration Agreement

Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Bloomer, Inc. (doing business as HER) and affects your rights. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.

### Scope

You acknowledge and agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website or to any other aspect of your relationship with HER will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or HER may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement. Now or in the future, there may be lawsuits against HER alleging class, collective, and/or representative claims. Such claims, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. The existence of such class, collective, and/or representative lawsuits does not mean that such lawsuits will ultimately succeed. But if you agree to arbitration with HER, you are agreeing in advance that you will not participate in or seek to recover monetary or other relief under such class, collective, and/or representative lawsuits. Instead, by agreeing to arbitration, you may bring your claims against HER in an individual arbitration proceeding. If successful on such claims, you could be awarded money or other relief by an arbitrator.

### Arbitration Rules and Forum

Arbitration Rules and Forum. This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act in all respects. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent, The Corporation Trust Company, at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, HER will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.

### Arbitrator Powers

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and HER. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding on you and HER.

### Waiver of Jury Trial

You and HER each knowingly and voluntarily waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and receive a judge or jury trial. You and HER are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. In any litigation between you and HER over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and HER waive all rights to a jury trial and elect instead to have a judge resolve the dispute.

### Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class basis. Claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor HER is entitled to arbitration. Instead, all claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 14 (Exclusive Venue) below.

### Opt Out

You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor HER can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify HER in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your HER username (if any), the email address you used to set up your HER account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to: hello@weareher.com and 1760 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA, 94103. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

### Survival of Arbitration Agreement

This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with HER.

### Exclusive Venue

To the extent the parties are permitted under this Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and HER agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the applicable county within the State of California.
