At MATCH, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and process data about you. This page is designed to inform you about our practices regarding cookies and explain to you how you can manage them.

**You already know everything there is to know about cookies and just want to adjust your settings**? No problem. Head on Cookie Settings to update your website cookies settings or head to your account settings in your app to adjust your privacy preferences there.

**You want to know more about cookies  and how we use them**? Happy to explain! Keep on reading.

_Note: This Cookie Policy does not address how we process your personal information , outside of our usage of cookies. To learn more about how we process your personal information, please read our Privacy Policy, [here](https://uk.match.com/pages/misc/privacy?styled=1)._

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory.  A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier. A cookie also may contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using our services.

**Are there different types of cookies?**

_First-party and third-party cookies_

There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser’s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website. Third-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers. You can learn more about these partners and service providers in our website’s and in-app consent management tools. For details on these tools, see _“How can you control cookies?”_ below.

_Session and persistent cookies_

There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently. Persistent cookies have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current session. These types of cookies can be used to help you quickly sign-in to our website again, for analytical purposes and for other reasons as described below.

**What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons and SDKs?**

Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  Tracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes from.  SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.

For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this Cookie Policy.

**What do we use cookies for?**

Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns and personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests. To accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you.

When you use our services, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your device.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Cookie type** | **Description** |
| **Essential  cookies** | These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you our services, such as enabling you to log in, remembering your preferences and keeping you safe by detecting malicious activity. |
| **Analytics cookies** | These cookies help us understand how our services are being used and help us customize and improve our services for you. |
| **Advertising & marketing cookies** | These cookies are used to determine how effective our marketing campaigns are and make the ads you see more relevant to you.  They perform functions like helping us understand how much traffic our marketing campaigns drive on our services, preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, selecting advertisements relevant to you and measuring the number of ads displayed and their performance, such as how many people interacted with a given ad. |
| **Social networking cookies** | These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our services through third-party social networking and other websites or services.  These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes. |

**How can you control cookies?**

There are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your cookie preferences may make using our services a less satisfying experience as they may not be as personalized to you. In some cases, you may even find yourself unable to use all or part of our services.

_Tools we provide_

You can set and adjust your cookies preferences at any time, by using the tool available on Cookie Settings or by heading to your account settings in your app and adjusting your app cookie preferences there.

_Browser and devices controls_

Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.  The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser help menu.

You also may be able to reset device identifiers or opt-out from having identifiers collected or processed by using the appropriate setting on your mobile device. The procedures for managing identifiers are slightly different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the help or settings menu of your particular device.

_Interest-based advertising tools_

Advertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programmes which allow you to opt out of any interest-based ads involving them. For more information on this, you can visit the following sites: [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://optout.aboutads.info/#!/); [Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/); [Appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) (apps only).

Opting out does not mean that you will not see advertising – it means you won’t see personalized advertising from the companies that participate in the opt-out programs.  Also, if you delete cookies on your device after you opted out, you will need to opt-out again.

**Google™ Cookies**

_Google Analytics_

We use Google Analytics, which is a Google service that uses cookies and other data collection technologies to collect information about your use of the website and services in order to report website trends.

For more information on how Google collects and processes data, visit [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)_._  You can opt out of Google Analytics by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) and opt-out of Google’s ad personalization at [https://adssettings.google.com/](https://adssettings.google.com/).
