### Broad visibility of your profile

There’s more to Match than just Match. Register with us, create your perfect online dating profile and so you don’t miss out on a chance to find that special someone, your profile can be made visible to members of our dating services for the over 50s or single parents if you’re part of categories of singles they address and you consented to it. That means you will increase your chances of being contacted!

For more information about your profile visibility [click here](https://uk.match.com/faq/managing-my-profile/where-will-people-be-able-to-see-my-profile/).

### Trust and safety

We want Match to be a fun, safe online dating site where you can meet serious, committed singles ready for a real relationship. The safety of our clients is our top priority, and we work hard to keep our site safe. We moderate every single profile picture and description on our site, and the protection of your personal data is our priority.

Plus if you ever feel uncomfortable about a profile or a message you receive you can always block or report a member to our moderators. They’ll be happy to help. We also have lots of tips about making sure you stay safe while you’re using our site and when you decide it’s time to meet in real life. Just take a look in our help centre.

### Cyber-bullying leads nowhere. Least of all to love.

Match is fighting cyber-bullying to give you a safer dating experience.  
If you receive messages which make you feel uncomfortable, you can:

* \- **Report a profile** to alert the Moderation and Safety team.
* \- **Block a profile** to avoid being contacted by that person again.

### Want to be more in control?

With Match, you’re in charge. You can visit singles’ profiles without alerting them, or set your preferences so you can only be contacted by singles who match your search criteria. The choice is yours!

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/incognito-e1f01db3710.svg)

Choose “Incognito Mode”

Incognito mode is your online dating superpower. It lets you view other people’s profiles discreetly – they won’t know you’ve visited – and ensures you only appear to people you know you’re interested in. Which means less hassle – and more chance of finding a date!

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/zen-4791a78334a.svg)

Opt for “Zen Mode”

Zen mode is great when you need a little peace and quiet. Activate it and only people who match your criteria will be able to contact you – so you know they’re worth a look.

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/marketing-26b4005d6eb.jpg)

### Here at Match, we pull out all the stops to help you find your special someone.

Every day, you’ll be sent personalised selections of singles’ profiles by email and via our push notifications. Check out our recommendations wherever you are – don’t let love pass you by!

How to encounter dating?

### Tell us who you are!

Talk about yourself. The secret? Be natural, honest and spontaneous. A few lines are enough to make an impression.

Why not add a bit of humour, too?  
Be precise: the more search criteria you complete, the greater your chances are of being contacted by singles who share the same interests as you.

Share your photos. Create an album that reflects your personality.

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/icon_text-d336ae05a27.svg)![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/phone_street-fd1d9ba3d5e.jpg)

Online dating may have led to an increase in casual dating and hook-up culture.

But people looking to meet singles on Match have chosen our service because they’re ready to start a real story. So how do you make sure someone you meet online understands you’re serious, and how do you establish those expectations?  
  
The secret isn’t really a secret, and it’s something you’ve almost certainly been told before. The key is to be yourself, be kind and be calm. And it all starts with writing your profile.  
  
Discover [mature dating](https://uk.match.com/p/singles/mature-dating/) on Match and browse [senior](https://uk.match.com/p/singles/senior-dating/) singles on our website.

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/icon_thumb_up-bbc45154da8.svg)![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/couple_sofa-86a298a210e.jpg)

Think about the sort of person you would like to share a long-term relationship with.

Looks matter, for sure. But the chances are you would choose someone who is genuine, considerate, interested in you and who makes you laugh. There’s nothing wrong with that: it’s the most human thing of all: we want to be with people who make us happy.  
  
When you write your online dating profile, make sure you’re the sort of person you would want to be with. Try to resist the temptation to talk just about yourself: make it clear you’re interested in other people too. What would you like to do together with your date? What do you enjoy in people? Show that you are someone who is great company, not just someone who expects people want to be with them.

Language matters when you’re online dating!
-------------------------------------------

### Words of love and everyday life

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/icon_activity-e5b3525c1fe.svg)![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/couple_phone-2225a62b800.jpg)

Don’t be afraid of words! All the new casual dating sites that have appeared recently have transformed the game of seduction into something like a video game.

The result? Many singles have given up dating altogether as it is just too exhausting! However, many singles are looking for serious, deeper and more authentic encounters and a long-term relationship.  
  
The key to this new demand for authenticity is through words. Yes, even in the instant world of online dating, words are what really count.

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/icon_edit-dc6b1b103a1.svg)![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/computer-dbde93877e3.jpg)

Let’s start with the words you use to describe yourself. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but our singles consistently tell us that a profile description matters more to them than a photo\*\*\*.

It’s important, especially on a serious dating site, that you take the time to make your written presentation as good as it can be, and reveal your true self honestly and carefully.  
  
And words can break the ice! It can be hard to introduce yourself to a single you find interesting; it is always difficult to find the right way to approach them and find THE message that will attract their attention. Anyone can write ‘hello’, but is it going to make you stand out from the crowd during your encounters? In dating first impressions count, and the first words you exchange online can make all the difference.

![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/icon_complementary-404ea1e83e0.svg)![](https://iliusstu-a.akamaihd.net/uk.match.com/hpv-convergence/couple_hug-46ac7fe93a8.jpg)

Finally, words say a lot during a first date in real life.

Looks really aren’t everything, and when you’re finally face-to-face in front of a person, you can’t hide behind your screen any more! But rest assured, people generally prefer good humour to good looks on a first date, and they want someone with whom they can share an interesting conversation. The most important thing is to be yourself and stay as natural as possible.
