4\. Rules of Conduct
--------------------

### 4.1 Introduction of the Rules of Conduct

The quality of interactions expected by both us and other users of the Services implies observing a certain level of ethical conduct in your expression and behaviour, respecting users and our Customer Care representatives as well as the laws and regulations in force. To meet this standard for quality, individual responsibility and ethics, we allow any user to report any content (photography, text, video, audio etc.), behaviour or comments made by a user that appears to be in violation of our Terms of Use, Safety Tips, Community Guidelines, third-party rights and the laws and regulations in force. Therefore, the list of prohibited content below is not exhaustive. As a result, by using the Services, you acknowledge and accept that the data you provide, as well as your behaviour, comments or published contents may be subject to acts of moderation and/or control by us in accordance with our moderation policies.

We reserve the right to inform the competent authorities in the event of unlawful activity(ies) on your part.

This account closure will take effect without prejudice to any damages and interest which may be claimed by us from you as restitution for the losses incurred by us as a result of any breach of these Terms of Use.

### 4.2 Detecting and reporting content contrary to our rules of conduct and/or illegal content

To ensure that our users comply with our rules of conduct and the obligations that apply to us when we host content, we have put in place measures and dedicated tools for moderation purposes.

In particular, we ensure the safety of our users by setting up automatic detection tools and a reporting tool near each profile and in the footer of our site. Our users can also contact our customer service department directly.

a) Detection devices

We use internal and external tools for automated detection of content that may violate our Terms of Use and Community Rules.

These tools include automatic scanning of profiles for inappropriate language and images, as well as manual review of suspicious profiles and activities.

For more information on content moderation, please see [this article](https://mtch.com/safety).

b) Reporting tool

We encourage all our users to report content and/or profiles that may violate our terms of use and/or constitute illegal content.

To report a profile, behavior or private content contrary to our rules of conduct, please :

* Click on the three-dot icon present on all profiles;
* Select “Report” and the reason for reporting;
* Send us all the information we need to process your report.

To report illegal content that is publicly visible to all users, you must :

1. Click on the three-dot icon present on all profiles;
2. Select “Report” and “If illegal content”:
3. Select the reason for reporting;
4. Send us all the information we need to process your report.
5. The reporting form is also available at the bottom of the “Report illegal content” page.

### 4.3 Consequences of non-compliance with our terms of use

As soon as we become aware of content or behavior that violates our terms of use, our moderation team will take appropriate action, which may include deleting the content, banning the user; as well as blocking e-mail addresses and other identifiers associated with malicious persons.

You can appeal moderation decisions by following the process outlined in the following help article.

5\. Services
------------

### 5.1 Free features

Your registration to the Services allows instant access to free features. These features are not the same depending on the type of Services you have registered for and may change over time.

Free features and functionalities notably include the creation of your account profile, certain search functionalities, browsing other user’s profiles and access to some events and activities. Communicating with other users generally requires a subscription.

### 5.2 Paid-for services

We operate a global business and provide Services to a diverse community of users. Our pricing structure may vary by country, length of subscription, distribution channel, special offers and promotions. We regularly test new features to provide users with increased functionality and free or paid-for options should they choose to use them. We may also from time-to-time change or stop offering certain types of Purchases.

Recurring subscriptions and/or one-off purchases (“Purchases”) allow access to additional features and functionalities. The details of such paid-for services (“Paid Service(s)”) are available for you to consult on our Services, prior to concluding a Purchase.

### 5.3 Events and Activities

When events or activities are offered, specific terms and conditions are applicable and available from the pages describing the events or activities.

### 5.4 Badges, distinctions and the like

We may from time to time offer profile badges, distinctions or similar items for users to obtain depending as to whether they fulfil the qualifying criteria to gain that item.

We make no representations or warranties regarding the holder of a badge, distinction or similar item, as they are generally earned based on that user’s self-declaration, which we cannot verify.

### 5.5 Personalised Services

Our objective is to help you find users via our Services who are likely to be of interest to you and that you would communicate with them.  To do this, we may offer you features (paid or free of charge) which use information about your activity on our Services or which enable us to improve the content you provide as defined in clause 8.2 of these Terms. By using our Services, you agree that this information and content may be processed using artificial intelligence systems (for example to create automatically generated content).

We also use an algorithm to recommend profiles that you might like. To find out more about how our profile recommendation method works, you can consult the help page.

6\. Procedure and conditions for Purchases
------------------------------------------

### 6.1 General

Depending on your locality and the way you access the Services (for example via a desktop, a web mobile version, or an app on iOS or Android systems), Purchases may be available via direct billing (for example via a payment card, Paypal, etc.), mobile carriers, in-app payment systems (such as App Store/Google Play). If you choose to make a Purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your Purchase with the applicable payment provider and your method of payment such as a payment card or your third party account such as App Store/Google Play’s Apple Pay/Google Play (your “Payment Method”) will be charged at the prices displayed to you for the Purchase(s) you have selected and you authorize us and/or Apple/Google or other third party account (as applicable) to charge you.

Your Purchase is confirmed at the point when your financial transaction is authorized and confirmed with your bank or third-party account (such as mobile carriers or Apple/Google’s App Store/Google play).

### 6.2 Subscription Auto-Renewal; Automatic Card Payment

If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription (a “Subscription”), your Payment Method will continue to be billed for the Subscription until the end of the current Subscription term. After your initial Subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, unless specifically provided otherwise at the time of the Purchase. By purchasing a Subscription, you are contractually committed to continue making any recurrent payments for the entire Subscription period and any ongoing renewal period, until you have terminated the auto-renewal of a Subscription.

Please note that some Subscriptions are the subject of special offers whereby the price is reduced for a specific period of time before renewing at the standard (non-reduced) price.

Your Payment Method information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic renewal payments of your Subscription.  You may update your Payment Method at any time. We may also update your Payment Method on the database provided by the relevant payment service provider. By accepting our Terms of Use, following such update you authorize us to continue taking payments due for each Purchase (whether a payment instalment or a renewal) using the updated Payment Method.

Objections to a payment already made should be directed to our Customer Care team at the address mentioned in the ‘Requests and Claims’ section below if you were billed directly by us. Please note, however that you are still obligated to pay any outstanding amounts you owe us until the end of the then Subscription period, provided you have also cancelled the auto-renewal of your Subscription.

### 6.3 Right to cancel straight after Purchase

Subscriptions start upon Purchase confirmation. Pursuant to applicable law, you have 14 days starting from the day following a Purchase to exercise your right to cancel it (without giving any reason), by filling out the cancellation form available [here](http://uk.match.com/pages/misc/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/11/cancellation-form-uk.pdf) or by writing to the email address listed in the ‘Requests and Claims’ section below. The refund will be made within 14 days from the date we were informed of your decision to cancel and will be processed on the same Payment Method you used for the original Purchase.

If you connect to your account and use the Services before the end of the cancellation period, this first log in following the Purchase of a Subscription constitutes an express request by you to have immediate access to the Services, for which you will be charged.

You can find additional information on the [Help page](https://uk.match.com/faq/) about the scope and application of your right to cancel.

Purchase via Apple/Google’s App Store/Google Play

If you purchased a Paid Service via the App Store/Google Play that you wish to cancel within 14 days after Purchase, cancellations and refunds are handled by Apple/Google under their own terms and conditions which we do not control. To request a refund, you must log in to your Apple ID/Google ID and follow Apple/Google’s cancellation and refund instructions.

### 6.4 Additional third-party services

The Services may contain advertisements and promotions offered over any third-party platforms and external resources such as third-party websites or mobile applications, social networks, etc. (“Third-Party Platforms”). We are not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of such Third-Party Platforms. If you choose to interact with Third-Party Platforms made available through our Services, their terms will govern their relationship with you. We are not responsible or liable for Third-Party Platform’s terms or actions.

7\. Your termination of Subscription – Profile suspension – Account closure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.1 Subscription termination (auto-renewal cancellation)

Unless otherwise stated when you purchase your subscription, the automatic renewal of a Subscription can be stopped from 24 hours after Purchase and until at least 48 hours before the Subscription is due to renew. We will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until the end of the then-current Subscription term.

Deleting our application from your device does not terminate your Subscription. If you want to terminate the auto-renewal, you will need to log on to your account and follow the instructions.

Once you have turned off the auto-renewal, you will then be entitled to continue using your Subscription until the expiry of its current term. Any remaining payment instalments of the Subscription’s total price will remain due and payable until expiry of the current term. You will then no longer have access to the Subscription from the date the current Subscription term expires, but you will still have access to the free features.

We also reserve the right to cancel the automatic renewal of your current Subscription at any time, for example in the event of changes to our offers. In such a case, we will inform you in advance of the cancellation of the automatic renewal.

### 7.2 Non-renewal of Subscriptions purchased via the Apple Store/Google Play

If you made a Purchase via Apple/Google, auto-renewals and terminations are handled by Apple/Google under their own terms and conditions which we do not control. To request the termination of a Paid Service, you must log in to your Apple ID/Google ID and follow Apple/Google’s instructions.

### 7.3 Profile suspension

If you no longer wish to receive messages or have your profile shown to other users, you can at any time request the suspension of your profile via your account on the Services. This suspension is temporary, it does not interrupt any Subscription you may have (including renewals) and does not extend the duration of your Subscription. You may reactivate your profile at any time.

### 7.4 Account closure

You may at any time close your account on the Services by following the instructions available in your account section. If you encounter any difficulties, you may contact our Customer Care team who can do this for you. You will no longer be able to use your account, including any Purchase, from the next business day following a closure request. Closing your account does not terminate any current Subscription; all Subscription instalments will remain due and payable for the remaining period of their current term even if you no longer use the Services.

Upon closing your account, you will receive a confirmation email.
