Users to verify their accounts and might ask for your phone number and, in some instances, we

might also ask that you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a robot!

activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Fruitz network and spoil things for everyone. This

verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You can also verify your photo

on a voluntary basis (to add the blue ‘verified’ badge to your profile).

For photo verification, we will scan each photo that you submit. The scan may include the use

of facial recognition technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile

photos. We do not add the verification photos to your profile. We will keep your verification

photo to scan and compare it with other photos you upload in the future.Data that FLASHGAP
