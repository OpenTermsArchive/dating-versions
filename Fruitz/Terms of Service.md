An Account can be created : 

 

4

•Via Facebook Connect, which allows FLASHGAP to use the User's first and last name, gender, age (deducted from the date of birth) and email address to create  a  Profile.  Consequently,  the  User  must  verify  the  authenticity  of  his information on Facebook before registering for the Services.  

•Via  the  User's  Apple  ID  or  via  SMS.  In  this  case,  the  User  must  enter  the information  attributed  to  him/her  on  his/her  civil  status,  namely  his/her  first name, gender and date of birth. 

The  User  then  identifies  himself  to  access  the  Services  by  the  same  means  as  when creating the Account, namely by Facebook Connect, the User's Apple ID or via SMS. Subject  to  the  validation  of  his  Account,  he  thus  benefits  from  permanent  and secure access to his Account.

As part of the above-mentioned verification, FLASHGAP may ask the User in question for  information  intended  to  assess  compliance  with  the  above-mentioned  Code  of Conduct,  including  personal  data  such  as  the  telephone  number  and/or  the  email address associated with the User's Account in order to get authenticated. 

3.4.Account security 

The User Account is strictly personal to the User. 

The  User  may  only  have  one  Account.  The  use  of  the  Services  through  multiple Accounts constitutes a serious breach of these TCU. 

Similarly,  the  login  details  of  the  Facebook  account  or  Apple  ID  are  personal  and confidential. The User is solely responsible for their use.

3.5.Receipt of unwanted or fraudulent emails
