2. DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION



2.1. Description of the Services



The Application provides Users with fun, user-friendly and respectful services that allow

making contact and meeting other Users according to their location and preferences

of the Users, either virtually or in real life, between those of mutual interest.



The purpose of the Services is to establish, through the Application, the most pleasant

connections possible to conduct real meetings for personal purposes. Each User is free

to discuss and establish relationships with other Users in accordance with these TCU.



Under no circumstances may the Services be considered as marriage counselling or

brokerage activities.



2.2. Support for the reception of Services



The Services are accessible to any person with Internet access on a smartphone or

tablet with a recent version of the IOS or Android operating system, subject to

downloading the Application from the App Store or the Play Store, as the case may

be.



The Application allows access to all the Services, subject to payment, if any.



All costs associated with accessing the Application, such as costs associated with paid

features and hardware, software or internet access costs, are the sole responsibility of

the User.



3. MEMBERSHIP AND ACCESS TO SERVICES



3.1. Conditions of access to the Services



Access to the Services is reserved, under their sole responsibility, to Users who meet the

conditions described in Article 6.1 below and who have previously accepted these

TCU.



By pressing the button "Connect with Apple", "Connect with Facebook" or "Connect

by SMS", the User expressly accepts in full, without condition or reservation, these TCU,

in particular those mentioned in the User Code of Conduct defined in Article 6 below.



The User can freely consult these TCU at any time on the Application by clicking on

the "Settings" tab and also on the Fruitz website via the URL http://www.fruitz.io/ terms.



3.2. Creating an Account



Access to the Application requires, after downloading, the creation of an Account.



An Account can be created:

5



• Via Facebook Connect, which allows FLASHGAP to use the User's first and last

name, gender, age (deducted from the date of birth) and email address to

create a Profile. Consequently, the User must verify the authenticity of his

information on Facebook before registering for the Services.



• Via the User's Apple ID or via SMS. In this case, the User must enter the

information attributed to him/her on his/her civil status, namely his/her first

name, gender and date of birth.



The User then identifies himself to access the Services by the same means as when

creating the Account, namely by Facebook Connect, the User's Apple ID or via SMS.

Subject to the validation of his Account, he thus benefits from permanent and secure

access to his Account.



3.3. Audit of accounts



FLASHGAP uses a combination of automated systems, user reports and a team of

moderators to monitor accounts and content to identify breaches of these TCU.



In case of suspected breach of these TCU, and more specifically of the Code of

Conduct defined in Article 6 below, the Account may be suspended at any time in

order to verify the existence of such breach.



As part of the above-mentioned verification, FLASHGAP may ask the User in question

for information intended to assess compliance with the TCU and the above-

mentioned Code of Conduct, including personal data such as the telephone number

and/or the email address associated with the User's Account in order to get

authenticated.



In case of confirmation, the Account in question may be automatically deleted by

FLASHGAP and the User in question may be banned from the Application.



In any case, FLASHGAP reserves the right at its sole discretion to terminate or suspend

any Account, restrict access to the App, or make use of any operational,

technological, legal or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without

limitation blocking specific IP addresses).



For users residing in the European Union (“EU”), we will notify you when we take action

against your Account or Your Content (defined below) unless it is not appropriate for

us to do so (for example, we are not permitted by law enforcement agencies). For all

other users, we may take such action, at any time without liability and without the

need to give you prior notice.



If you believe that FLASHGAP has made a mistake in taking action on your Account

or your Content, you can appeal using the processes outlined within the App or by

sending an email to the following address: contact@fruitz.io.



For users residing in the EU, you have additional rights under the Digital Services Act to:

(i) access third party out-of-court dispute settlement processes; (ii) seek remedies from

the courts in the EU member state in which you live; and (iii) lodge a complaint with

your local EU regulatory authority.

3.4. Account security

The User may only have one Account. The use of the Services through multiple

Accounts constitutes a serious breach of these TCU.

confidential. The User is solely responsible for their use.



The User is solely responsible for the consequences of the use of his Account and

acknowledges that any connection or data transmission made using his login details

will be deemed to have been made by him.



3.5. Receipt of unwanted or fraudulent emails



The User undertakes to protect himself against any exceptional risk of receiving

unwanted emails or emails allegedly coming from FLASHGAP.



The User must be alert and vigilant in order to warn FLASHGAP by sending a letter or
